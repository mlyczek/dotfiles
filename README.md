dotfiles
========

My configuration of dotfiles basing on idea of splitting them according to topic from [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s
[dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

## Documentation
The `doc` directory contains usefull descriptions on how to configure various things that couldn't be easily linked into files from `.dotfiles` and most often are some global configuration of the whole computer.
